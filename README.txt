I downloaded the file "FIR-0002_DataDictionary_fire-calls-for-service.xlsx." In the sheet titled "DataDictionary," I removed the first four rows, the first column and everything below row 40. I exported this as a csv file so that I can assign the right data types to my dataframe. 

Running the notebook is pretty straightforward. Put the dataset (as a csv) into the root directory of the repo. Then open the notebook with jupyter. From there, just run all the cells. I included a screenshot of how to navigate to kernel->restart and run all.

The only software a user may have to install are the python libraries that are used. These can be installed via pip.

I believe I completed all the tasks, but I did not get the trend described in the instructions regarding the back-to-back incidents. 

I spent about four hours on the project from my initial commit. I spent extra time rerunning the analyses with the full dataset.
